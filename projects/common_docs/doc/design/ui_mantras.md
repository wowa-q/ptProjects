# UI design mantras

## design is design is design

What you are doing is problem solving - not deoration. 

## Stop solving other people's problems

Design always for your problem, for your context

## Form does not and should not follow function

Functionality should not dictate what something should look like. The context in which the user is going to use it is dictating how it looks like. 

## On small screens less is more 

Put only what needs to be there

## balance creates visual order and signals relationships

## visual rythm speeds up comprehension and use

## good design is held together by harmony

## dominance directs user's focus

## align everything with everything else

e.g. Setup baselines variables for margines

## grouo and organize related content with proximity 

## use color to communicate and influence interaction

Color should not subject a personal opinion

## choose colors based on associations, emotions and brand

## cntrast always wins

Regardless what colors you use, contrast is stronger    

## typography should always be purposefully designed 

## icons shall be recognizable and memorable

Don't reinvent the wheel

## context of use should always dictate visual form

## simpler is better

in interactive UI design

## separate content from controls

Work always to separate content from controls
