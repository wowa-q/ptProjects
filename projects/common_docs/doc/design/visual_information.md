# Design principles

## Principle of balance - Creating visual order

Balancing means arranging positiv elements with negative space, so that no one area overpowers, unless it suppose to.

When a design is unbalanced, the individual elements compete with the whole.

## Rhythm

Rhythm occurs, when the the intervals between the elements is predictable, are similar in size, shape and length.

When elements repeat at regular intervals, the visual rhythms speeds identification and the users ability to quickly:
- infer what the elements are
- understand what they do

## Harmony

When visual elements are in harmony, they relate to and complement each other. 

Harmony is a big part of what holds individual elements together visually, to form a greater, cohesive whole.

Harmony comes largely from rhythm and repetition. Repetition re-emphasizes visual elements, connecting and creation area of attention.

Harmony is a visual echo.

Harmony should make the read direction (left to right and top to down). A clear purposeful flow.

## Dominance

Dominance is not a mater of size. It is a mater of contrast, placement and apperance. Dominance is achieved by emphasizing ne or more visual elements.

Dominance creates a **focal point**, where most people will automatically go at first glance. It creates entry point in the design; a starting from which you can lead the user/viewer to other parts of the screen.

From a primary dominant element the design flow is achieved by creating elements with secondary and tertiary dominance. (Hirarchy)

Dominance relies on contrast - clear differences between the visual field.

When there is no clear dominance between elements, they compete with each other. Without dominant element on screen, users have to work to find their entry point. -> people would leave.

## Alignment

Alignment is the most important design principle.

## Proximity (N채he, Nachbarschaft)

Proximity is the distance between visual elements. We use it to signal relationship between the elements. Elements visually close together are percieved as a single group, related by context of use. Unrelated are visually separated, from eachother.

# Color and Contrast

## Attention and Emotiuons

Interaction Cue of one type, shall be the same color. 
Color creates connection, continuity - use the same color scheme between different elements, to show that they belong together.

Color implies meaning. Color is subjective; our perceptions affect what it says to us. Some colors have universal appeal, others are specific to geography, cuture and expirience. Color selection has to be appropriately useful and meaningful for your audience/users.

Color should never be the sole differentiator of things in the UI. Color should highlight and guide. It is just an accent.

> For extended screen use situations, use light, muted background colors.

Color theory is useful. However, no need to understand everything.  Here some questions to guide through the color selection:
- Are colors used sparingly (sparsam)?
- Do your colors reinforce or interfere with hierarchy and content?
- Is the color scheme used consistently?
- Is color use functional, or just decorative? It must be functional.
- Does functionality depend on colors? (shouldn't be)

### Choosing color

- consider common associations with the color
    - Black: Authority and power; timeless; cool; brooding (br체tlerisch, gr체belnd); counter culture (arts & music)
    - White: Innocence (Unschuld) and purity; cleanliness and sterility; surrender and peace
    - Red: Alarm and urgency; attention; intensity; speed; warning of danger; love
    - Pink: Romance; gratitude (Dankbarkeit); grace (Anmut); admiration (Bewunderung); harmony; Compassion (Mitgef체hl); female
    - Blue: Peaceful; tranquil; sky; ocean; business; technology; innovation; male
    - Green: Nature; organic; calming; refreshing; relaxing
    - Yellow: Optimism; happiness; warmth (sunlight); positivity; joy; hope
    - Purple: Royalty; waelth; luxury; sophistication; considered feminine and romantic
    - Brown: Nature; Earth; home; friendship; richness; genuiness; solidity

- consider emotional impact:

    Red elements demand to be noticed, sscream for attention. 
    Red also signifies imprtance and priority, like a to-do list.  

    Blue tends to have a calming, inviting effect, due to associations with sky and water. It also communicates trust (bank, tech). Lighter blues are open and friendly; darker shades suggest security.

    Green is often associated wwith nature, success, growth and money. (in between warm and cool making it well balanced). It also feels fresh, new and in western culture signifies "OK".

- look at the world arround: Everything you see contains the four color variations required for good UI design:
    - Shadows
    - Midtones
    - Highlights
    - Accents

> the colory shall be choosen based on associations, emotions and brand

## Power of Contrast

Our eys are working to notice the contrast. -> Contrast is much more powerful than color. 

Contrast enables readability. Text is easily readable when stark, complementary colors are used. A desgn where text is the brightest element can reduce eye strain by focusing attention. It is a myth, that white on black is harder to read than black on white. 

contrast is also used to drwa attention: areas with hihgest contrast draw the users's attention first. Primary content or actions should have the most contrast. 

Contrast directs focus: Wherever yu apply the most contrast is where the user's attention will be drawn. (If that element insn't the most important thing on the screen, you are directing the user's focus in the wrong place). The core content or action should have the most contrast. Secondary content and actions (and everything else) should have lower conrtrast, by degrees.

> Contrast performs 3 essential functions.
 1. Contrast draws the user's attention to the essential components of the interface
 2. Contrast helps the user understand relationships between onscreen elements
 3. Contrast communicates hierarchy and signifies importance within and across multiple sets of visual information.  

> Color and contrast depend on context
