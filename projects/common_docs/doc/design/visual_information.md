# Pricipal of balance - Creating visual order

Balancing means arranging positiv elements with negative space, so that no one area overpowers, unless it suppose to.

When a design is unbalanced, the individual elements compete with the whole.

# Rhythm

Rhythm occurs, when the the intervals between the elements is predictable, are similar in size, shape and length.

When elements repeat at regular intervals, the visual rhythms speeds identification and the users ability to quickly:
- infer what the elements are
- understand what they do

# Harmony

When visual elements are in harmony, they relate to and complement each other. 

Harmony is a big part of what holds individual elements together visually, to form a greater, cohesive whole.

Harmony comes largely from rhythm and repetition. Repetition re-emphasizes visual elements, connecting and creation area of attention.

Harmony is a visual echo.

Harmony should make the read direction (left to right and top to down). A clear purposeful flow.

# Dominance

Dominance is not a mater of size. It is a mater of contrast, placement and apperance. Dominance is achieved by emphasizing ne or more visual elements.

Dominance creates a **focal point**, where most people will automatically go at first glance. It creates entry point in the design; a starting from which you can lead the user/viewer to other parts of the screen.

From a primary dominant element the design flow is achieved by creating elements with secondary and tertiary dominance. (Hirarchy)

Dominance relies on contrast - clear differences between the visual field.

When there is no clear dominance between elements, they compete with each other. Without dominant element on screen, users have to work to find their entry point. -> people would leave.

# Alignment

Alignment is the most important design principle.

# Proximity (NÃ¤he, Nachbarschaft)

Proximity is the distance between visual elements. We use it to signal relationship between the elements. Elements visually close together are percieved as a single group, related by context of use. Unrelated are visually separated, from eachother.
