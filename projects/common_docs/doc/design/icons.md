# Icons

Expirience from Outlook 98 designers: people didn't use the icons from the tool bat at all. They used the menu to start some actions, with the exception of "delete" icon, which they knew from the older version. Only after they added labels to the icons people understood what the icons mean. 

When sized large enough (48 px) they are easily activated. This makes them very easy to hit with a laptop or desktop cursor.

Icons save space: their compact size means more critical functionality can be displayed on a relativelly small space.

Icons are easy to recognise: **IF** users have familarity with the icons and have seen or used them before. 

> The icons should **clearly** convey meaning

## Four core types of icons

There four core types of icons:

1. Similar icons are useful for simple, easily understood actions and concepts. Example: Don't smoke icon
2. Symbolic icons represent an action, object or concept at high abstraction. Example: hamburger menu or printer
3. Example use images of things that exemplify or are commonly associated with an action, object or concept. Example: Mail icon
4. Arbitrary icons bear no resemblance to the represented concept. Their meaning is learned through repeated exposure. Example: USB icon

## Icon choice

Icon choice starts with their environment. 
- App icons should be based on commonly used Android or iOS icons.
- Laptop SW icons should be based on commonly used Windows or Mac Os icons or commonly used SW on these platforms.
- Website icons should be based on commonly used icons, along with those by competing or complementary sites. 

> If you spend more than 15 minutes trying to choose an icon to represent something - an icon won't probably work in that instance. 

> Icon + a label is hard to beat

> **Icons must be recognizable and memorable**

### 5 rules for effective icon design 

1. keep visual/perceived size consistant
    - icons that occupy the same pixel space on the grid are not neccessarly perceived of the same size
2. keep the level of detail consistent 
    - more detailed icon will attract the users' attention first - because they appear to have more visual weight than the others.
3. eliminate unnecessary detail
    - extra visual elements only make the icon more difficult to perceive, even if it is composed of recognizable objects. Think context 
4. don't mix and match styles
    - don't mix outline and fill styles in the same app or site
    - changing from outline to fill for a hover or active state is OK
5. don't reinvent the wheel
    - if the concept or action depicted is common, near-universal stick with the established icon used to represent it.
    - anything else invites confusion and becomes a cognitive obstacle

# Data visualization

> The greates value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see

It is only valuable if the user can quickly understand what he see. How you present data is a big deal.

Book recommendation: "three legged stool" 

## Data visualization types 

### Persuasive

between the designer and viewer: 
- represents a specific point of view 
- meant to change the oppinion or reinforce the existing oppinion
- bias (Tendenz) can unintentional 

### informative

between the data and the viewer:
- it must not be persuasive
- neutral presentation of facts
- meant to educate and not to persuade (watch bias)
- broad/deep data sets, distilled or introduced in stages (progressive)

### visual art

between designer and data:
- when intentional - outcome is just enjoyment
- when unintentional - can have negative consequences
Big data is great, but people need to understand what they see

## visual form

context of use is dictating the visual form:

- what does the user need to understand - how easy and quickly he'll be able to understand it?
- what matters most - to us and to the viewer?
- do the visuals accurately reflect the numbers?

### 5 rules to visualize data

1. Data is only useful, if they can be understood
    - if I don't understand it, I can't act on it and if I can't act on it it is practicaly worthless. 
    - data is not a goal here - it is a tool to understand and make change in the world
    - data without design is noise
2. You are designing for other people and they are not you. You need to design 
    - for their identity
    - for their motivation
    - for their language
    - for learned social context: color associations, icon recognition, reading patterns etc. 
3. You are designing for their context of use
    - what amount of information that person need in order to understand or act?
    - what motivation is he comming to the table with? what is their job?
    - how do those motivations influence how useful or actionable the vizualization is?
    - how much time can he spend with this information?
    - how quickly it will be useful or effective?
4. The usefulness of data decreases, when its volume increases
    - the more information in any give view the harder it is for the viewer to find what he cares most about or is depending on in order to act.
    - or what you need them to see
    - reveal knowledge and facilitate insight - instead of overwehlming with voluem.
5. The more brain power is required to decode your visualization, the less that is available for understanding it.
    - Every label, every shade, every dimension of data that daesn't directly contribute to your main message or to the viewer's core goal is noise.

### Simplifying visual information

### separate content from control

when there are to many choices it is easier for people to choose **nothing**. 
when everything is interactive - **nothing** is interactive. 

> content should always be clearly separated from controls. 

> separate primary + secondary actions

Economy, clarity and focus is created by differentiating **primary** actions.
