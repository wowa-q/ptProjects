# Design basics

## What is the design
Design is solving problems, not drawing pictures.

- does the design serve the purpose of its existance? (communicating brand message, information, education..)
- how should it be perceived and received by the audience/viewer?
- why does this matter to anyone?

If you don't have a good solution - you don't have a good problem.
Good graphic designs are good UI design

### Don't do that
1. Don't look at themes:
- these collections don't tell us anything about a problem they are going to use.
- We don't know how the decisions were made to choose this "design"
- We have no sense of wether wha we see is apporpiate (angemessen). appropriate is the key of a good design

2. Don't look for inspirations - you will not find an inspiration by looking to the work of others, but just a solution of others for other problem and it is not your problem

3. Don't look at trends

> Designer thinks hard about the appropriateness of the visual decisions and those decisions are made by research, investigation and facts. Understand **Context of use**

> Always think why you make this design decision.

## Form and Functions
Form and function must be the same
- gather the clients requirements 
- form needs to reflect the function of the product
- Communication and meaning must never be sacrifised in favor of visual design choices

_Book recommendation: "Universal Principles of Design"_

### Prescription vs. description

Variation of form of products compete for sales: The winner is whose variation in form (and integration of appropriate function) delivers the most relevant, appropriate and valueable expirience to the customer.

Insist that aestetic considarations in design should be secondary to functional considarations.

Our focus is on the expirience and not on function. Our expectation is the expirience.
- we have a mental model that predicts the expirience and tells us what we can expect
- when the UI sticks close to our metal model, the use is easier
- when use is easier we buy, we download etc. 

ask the right questions:
- What aspects of the design - feature, function, form are critical to success?
- When time and ressources are limited what design tradeofs would least harm the success?
- what visually communicates value?

### What really drives form?
In any kind of product there are some forces that affect the design:
- audience needs
- client desires
- ethical obligations
- aestetic preferences
- technology constraints
- cultural meaning/preferences
- functional requirements
- material properties (e.g. how big is the monitor)
- available time
- available budget
- available ressources

Digital product - balance btw.
- UI design
- information architecture
- Front-End HTML/CSS
- Backend data structure
- Programming and processes

Rules:
- Objects with different functions should also look differently aestetically
- Beauty can and does come from function

> visual complexity can obstruct a users's perception within **50ms** of exposure. If it looks to complex, we assume it is hard to use. -> immediate impact via ruthless editing needs to be achieved. => we include only what is useful for the task at hand.

Don't forget about the mental model: The user expects a button to be a button.

Icons usually shall have a label, unless the user is able to recognize what it does imediatelly (by his mental model). 

### 5 rules for smal screen designs

1. Focus on context of use
    - when are people using the app:
        - when they are stressed?
        - when they are bored?
        - when they are busy?
        - when they are lost?
2. Simplify, simplify, simplify    
    - Each screen shall take one primary action -> every screen provides something useful, meaningful, valueable. This makes the product easier to use.
3. Make a design for thumbs
    - Can people use their thumb (Daumen) to do the majority of their work?
4. design for fat fingers
    - Controls and their associated tap targets should be a minimum of 9mm (48px) in diameter.
    - provide space between targets
5. minimize the need to type 
    - typing on the phone is a pain (use autocomplete and personolized data)
