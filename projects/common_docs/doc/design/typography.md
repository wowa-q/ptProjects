# Job of typography

There is so much information, so the user is usually overwhelmed. It is the job of the typography to let user find what is interesting for him or let him focus on something. 

Typography has the duty to convey information in writing or onscreen. A printed work which cannot be read becomes a product without a purpose.


Appropriate typography creates:
- Readability
- Accessability
- Usability 
- Visual balance

> Typography is _not_ about choosing fonts. It  is about purposefullly combining letterforms to create optimal reading expiriences - which deliver appropriate emotional impact. It is about utilizing size, weight, space and style combinations to establish visual order, signal relationships and enhance understanding.

Even some available fonts provide a bad job in providing consistancy in space btw. the words and letters. 

## 7 Rules of typography

1. 2 type faces max
    - not more than 2 font families
    - Character width and weights of each font should be complementary to the other. e.g. Georgia and Avenir have similar character widths: this creates harmony
    - Kerning, or psaces between the letters is also similar
    - At the same time font pairings needs to have some visual difference
2. Limit line width
    - When line length is too wide, the eye has to work a lot harder to track the text - following and finding the beginning of the next line.
    - this makes reading and comprehension more difficult and much slower. 
    - The common standard is 60 characters per line. On mobile devices 30 - 40 characters per line.
3. Choose readability 
    - Text will be used at variouse  sizes on your UI (headlines, body, buttons, footer ..) -> choose a typeface which is readable at every size. 
    - Users will view your design on different devices with different screen sizes and resolution. 
    - the typeface should have enough weigth that letterforms don't degrade at small sizes. 
    - (i) You can check it out during the fonts selection - just check it with different sizes.
4. Choose legibility (Lesbarkeit)
    - Make sure all letterforms are clearly distinguishable in your typeface. 
    - Some fonts have poorly defined kerning - most free Google fonts have horrible kerning
5. Use space between the paragraphs
    - The eye cab rest bertween the paragraphs and accelarate the understanding and comprehension. Good selected white space between the paragraphs and left and right margin increases comprehension by 20%
    - Generously spaced content is easier to focus on and easier to process. 
    -> make clear segments of information
6. Align text elements in layout using baselines
    - when you have text elementson the single screen they should all share points of the common alignment.
    - Even if those chunks are unrelated, alignment helps keept the layout ordered and makes it easy to scan.
7. Use styles to visually differentiate content 
    - there are usually 3 styles: regular, italic, and bold - use them in your design to differentiate between types of content.
    - sometimes it removes the need of having 2 fonts totally

    ## Using images in a layout

    1. make sure it serves a purpose 
        - make sure you truly understand what the purpose is.
        - what message will it send?
        - what emotions it invokes?
        - how wil it support / reinforce the content?
        - how will it guide or intruct?
        - does it stregthen and deepen understanding or interfere / distract from it?
    2. focus on people and not on things
        - we are wired to regonize and connect with our fellow humans. You want people to see themselfs using what you are promoting. 
        - so an image of us using a product will always carry more resonance than an image of just a product.
        - images of people looking away from the camera also tend to work best - because that makes easier viewer to imagine they are that person. If someone is looking into the camers it feels not natural, like a fake.
    3. Cropping (Schneiden) can change the meaning
        - how you crop an image has a dramatic impact on how it is perceived (e.g. full body with physical attributes sends a different message like just a face)
    4. never go for a cheap shot
        - especially if it is sexist or demeaning or any way reducing a human subject to an object
        - not only that it is shallow and a bad taste - it is also quickly forgotten 
        - don't objectify - empower
    5. Don't forget the power of illustration
        - Illustration can be much more powerful than a photography
        - Particularly when the subject is something we see a lot - and as result are numb to.
        - Illustration can be more relevant and appropriate to its content; it can provide powerful, emotional support to editorials

## Dos and Don'ts of imagery

 - DO: 
    - show an actual person when a reference to that person is specific.
    - use illustration when specifity isn't possible or doesn't apply
    - if you are referencing to a specific product - show that product (e.g. show th interface the people are going to use of the SW)
    - look fo images that represent and tell **realistic** stories
    - use color and composition to create a focal point that communicates meaning
    - use images with only few meaningful elements, with minimal distractions.
    - strive for clear visual focus, which communicates the concept at a glance
    - build a narrative imply an interesting informative story
    - show a product and people in context of a real world situation
- Don't 
    - don't use posed, staged stock images that feel faked an unemotional
    - don't use default to generic literal stock photos
    - don't make the user hunt for the hidden meaning(s) in your image
    - don't obscure the point of focus, which also obscures meaning and diminishes power. (don't create visual noise)
    - don't use photos whose lack of focus makes the image meaningless
    - don't use images without **context**, these don't convey mood, brand and context. 
    - don't show a product and its user **disassociated** from the context - it is not interesting
