# Summary

* ChattGPT 3.5 has data until **September 2021**.
* ChattGPT 4 has data until **April 2023**.
> LLM is not working logically, but is predicting the following tokens, based on entered promt and context.

## ideas how to use AI

- Use LLM Api to generate story books.
- Create program, which can be used to generate QR code (GPT4 can directly generate QR code)


## GPT4 features

- Predefined GPTs: with stored preferences can be created
- specialized GPTs e.g. already exists catoonize yourself GPT, generates cartoon variant of an uploaded picture.
    - Own GPTs can be created
- Webbrowsing: can search results from internet
- Can work with documents: you can upload documents
- Can work with images: Use DALL-E3 to create or to analyze the images (e.g. extract text from the image).

## Other models

- Microsoft Copilot: 
    - verwendet das gleiche Modell wie GPT 4
    - verwendet wie GPT DALL-E3 in der kostenfreien Variante
    - unterstützt Browsing-feature und Benutzung der aktuellen Daten aus dem Internet
    - ist in Micrososft Edge integriert und kann mit jeder Webseite, als Kontext genutzt werden.
- Google Gemini
    - hat eigenes LLM Modell
    - kann mit Google Account genutzt werden
    - kann ebenfalls mit Bildern arbeiten ( Gemini 2.5 Flash, an agent-to-agent framework, and upgrades to image, video, voice, and music platforms, the tech giant is becoming a one-stop shop for all things AI.)
    - Gemini hatte ein Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protokoll veröffentlicht.
    - Gemini ADK API ist in Python (ADK: Agent Development Kit)
- Anthropic Claude
    - chatt gut für Code generierung
    - soll performanter sein als andere
    - kann gut Dokumenten zusammenfassen
- Midjorney

# Prompt Engineering

> Context is super important!


## General rules

> **[Rolle]** + **[Ziel]** + **[Konext: Extra-Information]**

- Benutze kurze, pregnante Sätze.
- Vermeide unnütze Information
- Vergebe dem Chatt-Boot eine spezifische Rolle.
- Definiere das Zielpublikum
- Definiere Tonnfall, Style, Länge der Ausgabe und Format
- Benutze die wichtigen Schlüsselwörter bei Anfragen

Beispiel:


- Rolle:  Du bist ein erfahrener Python SW Entwickler
- Ziel: Erstelle ein Code-Snippet in Python, welcher nach .jpg Dateien in dem vorgegebenen Ordner sucht und entfernt.
- Zielpublikum: Der Benutzer des Scripts soll in der Lage sein den Ordner dynamisch anzugeben.
- Style: Erstelle nur den Code, ohne zusätzlichen Erklärung.

## Promt techniques

### Zero- One- Few-Shot Promting

Bei dieser Technik gibt man kein (zero) oder ein (One-) oder meherere Beispiele bei der Anfrage an. 

- Man kann auch ein Template vorgeben, welchen GPT ausfüllen soll um den Format vorzugeben.
- Man kann auch Tipps geben, wie z.B. ein Artikel zusammengefasst werden sollte. _"Starte mit: Die Schlüsselaussagen des Artikels sind: - .."_

### Ask-Before-Answer Promting

Bei dieser Technik fragt man ob irgendwelche Zusatzinformation benötigt wird. z.B. _".. Brauchst du irgendwelche zusätzliche Information zu .."_

### Weitere Techniken

- Perspective prompting: GPT soll eine bestimmte Perspektive annehmen um eine Antwort zu generieren. Es können auch mehrere geben. z.B. Kann GPT zu einem bestimmten Theme Pros und Cons diskutieren.
- Contextual prompting: gebe zusätzliches Kontext, kulturel, historisch, situativ
- Emotional prompting: gebe den emotionalen Zustand oder Ton an.
- Laddering prompting: teile ein größeres Thema in kleinere Blöcke und handle sie eins nach dem anderem ab. GPT kann dabei befragt werden wie das Thema zerstückelt werden könnte.
Es gibt noch viele anderen, nach den gegoogelt werden kann. Es gibt auch **Super Prompts** für bestimmte Bereiche, die verwendet werden können.

> Frage GPT ob er Möglichkeiten sieht das Ergebnis der Ausgabe zu verbessern.

## Content generation

- Add Contraints:
    - Target audience
    - Topic related Keywords ()
    - What are the Highlights
    - Article Length
    - Adding Images

Example: Let GPT first create Outlines, before writing the article. Also keywords can also be generated GPT.

Ich kann eine Text-Datei hochladen, damit GPT etwas damit macht. Es kann auch eine Datei erstellen, z.B. eine Textdatei, die man runter laden kann.

Use GPT as a Copywriter - to advertise stuff.

Prepare interviews:
- share the type of questions to be asked
- start with ice breaker
- put the personal questions to the end

CV can be written by the GPT + Compelling Cover Letters + E-Mails

Writing CVs:
- share the clear vision
-
